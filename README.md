## The Platnium Operating System


</div>

### Description

This is a awsome Operating System with some features just like Windows. This includes a real working Delete Folder(recycling bin in windows), though i am having trouble with the restore feature. Add a new folder, change the name or delte the folder. Add a text file, deletion and re-naming does work, though i am now working on the text editer or Platnium OS. A run feature, so you can start any program by clicking File - Run. The interface is like a mac, all of the features are in a menu bar at the top. This also includes a "Updater" feature. So when you want to update the OS, you just click "file - Get Updates" then it will take you to a website where you can download updates (site is not up yet). This is just the beginning version of the OS, and there will be many more updates and features to come. All you have to do is just double click on the folder icon to open it. And PLEASE dont be so hard, i am only 13 years old.
